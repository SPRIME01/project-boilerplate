# Software Design Specification

---

#### 1. Project File Structure and Tools

**File Structure:**

```
project-root/
├── domain/          # Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Events, Domain Services
├── application/     # Use Cases (Interactors), Application Services, DTOs
├── infrastructure/  # Implementations of interfaces (e.g., repositories, message queues, databases)
├── presentation/    # UI code (e.g., controllers, views)
└── tests/           # Unit and integration tests for each layer
    ├── domain/
    ├── application/
    └── infrastructure/
```

This structure clearly reflects a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) clean architecture implemented in a mono-repository setup.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **Build Tools:**
  - **CMake:** Used to configure and manage the build process.

- **Linters and Formatters:**
  - **Python:** Ruff and mypy for linting and type checking.
  - **TypeScript/JavaScript:** ESLint and Prettier for ensuring consistent code style and automatic formatting.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - **Python:** Managed using `uv` (integrated through your `pyproject.toml` file).
  - **TypeScript/JavaScript:** Uses Deno for dependency management and runtime.

- **Testing Frameworks:**
  - **Python:** Pytest and pytest-BDD form the testing backbone, ensuring robust unit and integration tests.
  - **TypeScript/JavaScript:** Jest is used for running tests.

- **Additional Tools and Integrations:**
  - **Snyk:** For scanning vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - **Sonar:** For continuous code quality analysis.
  - **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, linting, building, and deployments.
  - **Pre-commit Hooks:** Execute pre-commit hooks to catch potential issues early before code is committed.

#### 2. Software Architecture

- **Loose Coupling via Ports and Adapters:**
  Your system leverages the ports and adapters (Hexagonal) pattern to isolate core business logic from external dependencies. This ensures components remain flexible and can be replaced or updated independently.

- **Dependency Injection:**
  Dependencies are provided via dependency injection, keeping components loosely coupled and testable.

- **Event-Based Architecture:**
  The system uses an event bus (with implementations like RabbitMQ) for event-based communication. This facilitates asynchronous processing and scaling.
  - Communication:
    - **External Communication:** Utilizes FastAPI to expose interfaces.
    - **Internal Communication:** Leverages GraphQL for structured interaction between front and backend services.

- **Configuration Management:**
  All environment-specific and sensitive values are managed through an `.env` file. The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude the `.env` file, ensuring no hardcoded secrets end up in version control.

- **Overall Scalability:**
  This architecture, built on loosely coupled components with event-driven flows, ensures the system can scale horizontally and adapt to increasing loads.

#### 3. Deployment and CI/CD

**Workflow Explanation:**

- **Local Development (Pre-Commit):**
  - Pre-commit hooks are run locally to catch style issues, formatting inconsistencies, and common errors early.

- **GitHub Actions (CI):**
  - **Triggering Events:**
    Initiated by pushes and pull requests to specified branches.
  - **Workflow Steps:**
    - **Environment Setup:** Establishes the Python environment.
    - **Dependency Installation:** Installs project dependencies.
    - **Pre-commit Checks:** Reruns pre-commit hooks in the CI environment.
    - **Testing:** Executes the full suite of tests to ensure code integrity.
    - **Build and Packaging:** Optionally packages the application on pushes to the main branch.

- **GitHub Actions (Deployment):**
  - **Deployment Trigger:**
    A separate workflow is triggered by pushes to the main branch.
  - **Deployment Process:**
    Deploys the built package to the target environment using tools such as Docker and Docker Compose.

- **Version Pinning:**
  Specific versions of tools are pinned in configuration files (e.g., `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) and GitHub Actions workflows to ensure reproducibility.

- **Static Analysis and Test Coverage:**
  - Utilizes static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, CodeClimate) for code quality.
  - Maintains high test coverage with tools like coverage.py, and integrates these metrics into GitHub Actions.

- **Secrets Management:**
  GitHub Secrets are used to securely manage sensitive details like API keys and credentials.

- **Branching Strategy:**
  A structured branching strategy (such as Gitflow) is adopted to manage development and production releases effectively.

- **Modular Workflows:**
  Complex CI/CD workflows are broken down into smaller, reusable actions for easier management.

- **Caching:**
  Employs caching mechanisms within GitHub Actions to reduce build times.

- **Notifications:**
  Automated notifications are set up to alert teams of build failures or successful deployments.

**Tools Involved:**

- **Configuration Management:**
  - `pyproject.toml` lists dependencies and integrates with `uv lock` for dependency management.

- **Testing:**
  - Pytest and pytest-BDD for behavior-driven tests.
  - Coverage tools to track test coverage and report via GitHub Actions.

- **Static Analysis and Build Tools:**
  - Tools like SonarQube and CodeClimate for code analysis.
  - Build and packaging via uv and make.

- **Deployment:**
  - Docker and Docker Compose are used to automate deployment processes.

- **Secrets and Version Control:**
  - GitHub Secrets for credential management and version pinning for reproducibility.

#### 4. Documentation and Code Comments

- **Comprehensive Docstrings:**
  Ensure every class, method, and function includes clear and descriptive docstrings, providing both usage context and explanations. This supports the automatic generation of external documentation.

- **Inline Comments:**
  Utilize inline comments to explain the rationale behind complex logic and to highlight non-obvious code sections. Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code does.

- **Clarity and Consistency:**
  Maintain a consistent documentation style and tone across the project. Use standardized terminology to aid comprehension.

- **Structured Code Examples:**
  Include clear, concise code snippets in your documentation to demonstrate usage and functionality. This benefits both team members and future contributors.

- **External Documentation Generators:**
  Consider using tools like Sphinx (for Python) to generate comprehensive external documentation from your docstrings, ensuring the docs stay in sync with the code.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  Embed documentation updates into the development workflow so that changes in functionality are accompanied by corresponding updates in the docs.

#### 5. Logging, Error Handling, and Performance Monitoring

**Centralized Logging with OpenTelemetry and Grafana:**

- **Instrumentation:**
  The application uses the OpenTelemetry Python SDK for logging instrumentation. This enriches log statements with contextual metadata captured as the application runs.

- **Log Processing via OpenTelemetry Collector:**
  After instrumentation, logs are forwarded to an OpenTelemetry Collector. This collector processes the telemetry data and routes logs to the appropriate backend.

- **Log Storage in Loki:**
  The OpenTelemetry Collector sends logs to Loki, which indexes them based on labels defined during instrumentation. This setup facilitates efficient querying and filtering of log data.

- **Visualization with Grafana:**
  Grafana is used to query Loki, enabling the creation of dynamic dashboards that visualize the logs. These dashboards support monitoring application behavior and quickly diagnosing issues.

**Error Handling:**

- **Centralized Exception Management:**
  A centralized error handling mechanism or middleware ensures that exceptions are caught, logged (via OpenTelemetry), and processed uniformly.
- **Automated Alerting:**
  The logging and error-handling infrastructure supports alerting mechanisms which notify development or operations teams when critical issues occur.

**Performance Monitoring:**

- **Metrics Collection with OpenTelemetry:**
  Performance metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization are collected alongside log data.
- **Visualization and Alerting:**
  These metrics flow through the same pipeline and are visualized in Grafana, where alerts can be configured based on set thresholds, ensuring prompt response to performance degradation.

**Conceptual Flow:**

```
[Your Application] --> [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation (SDK)] --> [OpenTelemetry Collector] --> [Loki] --> [Grafana]
```

This end-to-end approach for logging, error handling, and performance monitoring ensures that your system remains robust, scalable, and observable under various conditions.
